Flash-IN-VB Tutorial v1.2.1
Tutorial updates README
23/Jan/2002

Hi!

First of all, thanks to everybody who wrote for the comments and tips. 
The improvements you see here come directly from your input. Special
thanks go to Stuart McGougan for helping me out with the WinXP-stuff.

OK... With that aside, here's a brief list of the updates to this
tutorial. If you want more features, or if you just want to send a
comment, don't hesitate to send me a quick e-mail or ICQ message or
whatever.

-----------------------------
1. 100% Windows XP-compatible
-----------------------------
The version before this one didn't work correctly in NT environments,
since the API for the window-moving function was designed for Win9x.
After a few tweaks, the code was working fine.

-------------------------------------
2. Flash right-click menu disabled at last!
-------------------------------------
The only way to disable Flash's obnoxious right-click menu (that I 
know) is to change the "WMode" property of your Flash Control (OCX) 
instance on your form to "Transparent" (FYI, the default value is 
"Window"). You can do this using the control's property page, or 
by simply typing it in the property grid.

After this change, you will lose the "BackColor" property (also known
as "BGColor") in Flash. to remedy this situation, simply change the
"BackColor" property on the form containing the control to the desired
value in VB. That's about it! :)

If you know of a better/faster way to *completely* disable the 
right-click menu, please let me know. I might implement it on the next
version.

-------------------------------------------------------
3. Bundle your SWF file *inside* the executable itself!
-------------------------------------------------------
In order to make this work, you may need the Resource Compiler (the 
file name is "RC.EXE") program, which is normally under the "Wizards" 
subfolder, under VB's installation folder. If you do not know how to 
use it, you may still make this work by using the "VB6 Resource Editor" 
Add-In (Located in the "Add-Ins" menu of the VB6 IDE). I have not 
tested this using the add-in, although there shouldn't be any problems 
with it.

OK... Follow these steps:

1. Open your project folder (i.e. "C:\Windows\Desktop\FlashTutorial")
2. Right-click on the window, and click on "New|Text Document"
3. Rename the newly-created file to "tutorial.rc" (please note that the
file HAS TO END WITH AN "RC" extension, or this will NOT work).
4. Double-click on the new text file, and add this line:

555 SWF tutorial.swf

"555" is just an ID number. You can use whatever number you like, as
long as it's referenced correctly within VB.

5. Click on "Start|Run...", and locate the "RC.EXE" file on your hard
disk. after that, type the following at the end of the "Run" dialog:

-r "[FLASHTUTORIAL_FOLDER]\tutorial.swf"

... where "[FLASHTUTORIAL_FOLDER]" stands for the path of the 
"tutorial.swf" file.

This should make the end text to be something *similar* to the 
following:

"[RESOURCE_COMPILER_FOLDER]\RC.EXE" -r "[FLASHTUTORIAL_FOLDER]\tutorial.swf"

...where "[RESOURCE_COMPILER_FOLDER]" stands for the path of the
"RC.EXE" program.

6. Click on "OK" to start the compilation. if everything was done
correctly, a new RES file, named "tutorial.res", will be created on the
same path as your "tutorial.rc" file.

7. Now all you need to do is to associate the RES file to your VB
project. You do this by right-clicking on the Project Explorer, and
selecting "Add|Add File" on the context menu. After that, just locate
your "tutorial.res" file, and click "OK" to add it to your project.

8. Copy the code on the "CreateMovie" Sub (located on the main form)
to your application, remembering to change the name of the "xWin"
control to the one on your form.

9. After that, you're all set; just run the application, and enjoy!

I hope this helps to make your coding experience more enjoyable. I have
been building programs in Flash and VB for some time now, and I can
really say that I haven't had this much fun designing and coding in a
long time. Hope you do too... :)

Please remember that I can be contacted either using this tutorial's 
PSC window (that's where you downloaded this program), or either by
contacting me on bernardokuri@vbmail.net, or by ICQ (my number is 39074717).

Have a good time!
